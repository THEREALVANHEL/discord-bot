// commands/index.js (REPLACED - Converted to CommonJS)
// This file centralizes the command execution logic for the AI handler in messageCreate.js

/**
 * Attempts to execute a command generated by the AI.
 * * NOTE: The logic here simply logs the command attempt and returns true
 * to indicate it "handled" the command, preventing an error.
 * Full command processing logic would integrate the client.commands collection.
 * * @param {Client} client The Discord client instance.
 * @param {Message} message The message object that triggered the command.
 * @param {string} name The name of the command (e.g., 'ping', 'say').
 * @param {string[]} args Arguments for the command.
 * @returns {Promise<boolean>} True if the command was recognized and mocked, false otherwise.
